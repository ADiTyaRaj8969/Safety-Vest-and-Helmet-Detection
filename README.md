# 🦺 Safety Equipment Detection using YOLOv8

This project performs **real-time detection** of safety helmets and vests on individuals using **YOLOv8**. It helps monitor compliance with safety protocols in environments like construction sites and factories.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects **helmets** and **vests**
- 👷‍♂️ Classifies people as:
  - ✅ SAFE (Helmet + Vest)
  - ⚠️ PARTIAL (Only Helmet or Only Vest)
  - ❌ UNSAFE (No safety gear)
- 🎨 Color-coded bounding boxes:
  - Green = Safe
  - Yellow = Vest only
  - Cyan = Helmet only
  - Red = No gear
- 📹 Real-time webcam or video input
- 🧠 Trainable on custom datasets

## 📦 Installation

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
#Training the Model
Make sure your dataset is annotated and referenced in Q1/data.yaml.

To start training:
bash

python train.py
The best model weights will be saved to:
swift

Q1/runs/detect/vest_helmet_final/weights/best.pt
 Running Inference
Open safety_detection.py and ensure this path is set:

python

MODEL_PATH = "Q1/runs/detect/vest_helmet_final/weights/best.pt"
Run the detection:

bash

python safety_detection.py
Opens webcam by default (cv2.VideoCapture(0))

Press q to quit

🎨 Bounding Box Colors
Status	Description	Box Color
✅ SAFE	Helmet + Vest	Green
⚠️ PARTIAL	Helmet only / Vest only	Cyan / Yellow
❌ UNSAFE	No helmet, no vest	Red

🏷️ Class Labels (YOLO Format)
Make sure your dataset uses the following labels:

0: No Vest

1: Helmet

2: Vest

These labels are used in both training and detection.

🧰 Technologies Used
